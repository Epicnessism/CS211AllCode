PROBLEM 1: TESTING
==================

(10%) The correct implementation is #: (fill in your answer below
imp???

imp8 is the correct implementation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN FAULTY IMPLEMENTATIONS
----------------------------
(4%) Describe the general problems with imp11
The issue with imp11 is that it failed the mode tests where multiple answers were expected.
It failed mode 1,2,and 5. Everything else, including the Pair class, uniques, and contains methods
worked fine on imp11. It was the mode method that only worked when returning a single answer.


(4%) Describe the general problems with imp12
imp12 failed the second half of test mode_2 which tested for being able to return
multiple modes in a pair list. We can ascertain that the contains method works since
it passed all contains test cases. We can also deduce from this test case that imp12's
mode method works for integers and strings since it did not fail tests mode_1 or mode_3.
It must have something to do specifically with Pair lists being inputted.


(4%) Describe the general problems with imp13

When testing an empty list, test mode_3 expected an empty list to be returned without
nothing inside, not even null. Instead, imp13 raised an OutOfBoundsExcetion which means
that the implementation does not accomodate for 0 length/no value lists. Although mode
uses contain method, we can ascertain that imp13's contains method functions correctly
because it passed all contains test cases.

PROBLEM 2: DEBUGGING
====================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(55%) Include the command line you found to pass as many phases as
possible. Include your NetID at the beginning.  To complete all
phases, a total of 29 command line args including NetID are required.

(5%) Describe your experience using the debugger. What helped, what
frustrated, and what lessons will you take forward? Limit your
description to one to two paragraphs.

It was a mixture of both good and bad. It helped when trying to dig through what was going on one step at a time especially when things got messy.
Something I found really frustrating was when there were multiple methods involved, debugger would temporarily lose all its variables for everything else
except for the variables in the method currently being run. It would be nice if debugger would make tabs in the debugger so you can switch inbetween method
and compare the variables inside different methods at the same time. Also, being able to step into and step out of the code was really nice, allowing for more options
when running through the code line by line. I also really didn't like how the debugger went away each time i recompiled the code. I want it to stay there.
Lessons I will take forward is that when writing code, comments really help. Also, variable name consistency is good when trying to debug code. Also I have learned that debugger
is really nice for long pieces of complex code that don't work without debugging.
